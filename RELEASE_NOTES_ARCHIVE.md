- **TypeScript checking**: `npm run check` for compilation validation
- **Clean git history**: Only commits final bundled output
- **Better documentation**: Complete development guide

## üîß Changes

  with:
    region: 'oss-cn-hangzhou'
    access-key: ${{ secrets.OSS_ACCESS_KEY }}

    bucket: 'my-bucket'
    assets: |
      dist/:website/
      README.md:docs/readme.md
```

### For Contributors
1. **Update your workflow**: Use `./build.sh` instead of manual `npm run build`
